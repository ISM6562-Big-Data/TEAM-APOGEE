# Project Report: Translating RDBMS Schema to Cassandra for YouTube Data

## Introduction

This project focuses on the translation of Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) schemas into Apache Cassandra schemas, specifically tailored for big data applications using YouTube as a case study. The aim is to harness Cassandra's capabilities for fast reads and writes, as well as horizontal scalability, to address the demands of handling large volumes of data. This report outlines the project's scope, objectives, and the significance of this translation in the context of big data applications.

## Analyze the RDBMS Schema

### Overview

The RDBMS schema designed for the YouTube application is detailed below, highlighting its key components, relationships, and assumptions made about the data and its usage. The schema is normalized to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.

### Components and Relationships

- **Tables:** Describe each table included in the YouTube RDBMS schema, including columns, primary keys, and any foreign keys.
- **Relationships:** Discuss the relationships between tables, including one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.
- **Assumptions:** Note any assumptions about the data or its usage that influenced the schema design.

## Query Analysis

This section lists and analyzes the essential queries for the YouTube application's functionality. The analysis guides the translation of the RDBMS schema into a Cassandra schema, focusing on optimizing these queries.

### Essential Queries

- List the queries considered essential for the application.
- Discuss how these queries influence the design of the Cassandra schema.

## Design Cassandra Schema

Adopting the "Query First" design philosophy, this section documents the process of translating the YouTube RDBMS schema into a Cassandra schema.

### Design Process

- **Query Optimization:** Explain how the Cassandra schema is designed around the essential queries identified earlier.
- **Data Model Influences:** Highlight the differences in schema design between Cassandra and traditional RDBMS, focusing on Cassandra's data model.

### Final Cassandra Schema

- **Table Designs:** Present the final Cassandra table designs, including partition keys, clustering columns, and any secondary indexes.
- **Justification:** Justify the design decisions, focusing on performance and scalability.

## Discussion

Reflect on the challenges and considerations encountered during the schema translation process. Discuss the trade-offs of using Cassandra over traditional RDBMS for the YouTube application.

### Challenges and Considerations

- Describe the challenges faced during the translation process.
- Discuss any considerations that had to be made due to Cassandra's data model and architecture.

### Trade-offs

- Analyze the trade-offs of using Cassandra instead of a traditional RDBMS, considering the application's requirements.

## Conclusion

Summarize the key learning outcomes from this project and discuss the potential real-world implications of the schema design decisions made for the YouTube application. Highlight how these decisions could influence the application's performance and scalability in a big data context.
