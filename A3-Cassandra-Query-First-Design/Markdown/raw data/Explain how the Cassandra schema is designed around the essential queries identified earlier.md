The Cassandra schema we've discussed is meticulously designed to align with the specific query requirements of our application. Let's dive into how each table in the Cassandra schema serves the essential queries identified earlier, reflecting the principle of designing around query patterns in Cassandra:

### 1. Retrieving User Information

For operations like fetching user profiles and logging in (which may require looking up by username or email), we have proposed creating tables `users_by_username` and `users_by_email`. This design decision ensures direct and efficient access to user information using either a username or an email, which is crucial for login operations. This approach exemplifies Cassandra's design philosophy where data duplication across tables is acceptable to ensure query efficiency.

### 2. Listing Videos Uploaded by a Specific User

The `videos_by_user` table is designed with `user_id` as the partition key and `video_id` as a clustering key. This arrangement enables the efficient retrieval of all videos uploaded by a specific user. The clustering order could further be defined to sort these videos by upload date or other relevant criteria, thus directly supporting the listing videos query.

### 3. Incrementing Video Views

The video views are updated through the `videos_by_user` table, leveraging the video's `video_id`. By structuring the table to allow easy access via `user_id` and `video_id`, the schema supports efficient updates to the views count for any given video, reflecting the requirement for an efficient update operation for incrementing video views.

### 4. Fetching Comments for a Specific Video

The `comments_by_video` table, with `video_id` as the partition key, is optimized for fetching all comments associated with a specific video. This design choice ensures that comments are easily and efficiently retrievable by video, supporting the query pattern for fetching video comments.

### 5. Retrieving Comments Made by a Specific User

Similarly, the `comments_by_user` table uses `user_id` as the partition key, facilitating the efficient retrieval of all comments made by a specific user. This table structure is tailored to the query pattern for fetching a user's comments across videos.

### 6. Listing Users Who Liked a Specific Video

The `likes_by_video` table is designed with `video_id` as the partition key. This table structure supports the direct and efficient retrieval of all users who have liked a particular video, directly catering to the query requirement for listing users who liked a video.

### 7. Tracking Videos Liked by a User

For tracking which videos a user has liked, the `likes_by_user` table, with `user_id` as the partition key, enables the application to efficiently list all videos liked by a specific user. This design is an example of tailoring your data model to support specific read patterns, in this case, tracking likes by a user.

### 8. Viewing Channel Subscriptions

The `subscriptions_by_user` table uses `subscriber_id` as the partition key, enabling efficient queries to view all channels a user is subscribed to. This table design is optimized for the subscription viewing pattern, ensuring that subscription information is easily accessible by subscriber ID.

### Summary

This schema exemplifies Cassandra's design principle of modeling your data based on how you will query it, rather than trying to minimize data duplication as you would in a traditional relational database. Each table is specifically designed to support one or more of the identified query patterns, ensuring efficient data retrieval that aligns with Cassandraâ€™s strengths in handling large-scale, distributed data. By duplicating data across tables where necessary, we prioritize query performance and scalability, key advantages of using Cassandra for applications with heavy read and write requirements.
