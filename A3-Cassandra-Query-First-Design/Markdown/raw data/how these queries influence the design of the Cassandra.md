The queries you've mentioned have direct implications on how you should design your Cassandra database. Let's go through each query and discuss its impact on the Cassandra data model:

### 1. Retrieving User Information

**Influence on Design:** To efficiently support fetching user profiles and logging in (which could involve looking up by username or email), you'll need to ensure that `username` and `email` can be used to quickly retrieve user information. In Cassandra, this typically means creating additional tables that use `username` and `email` as partition keys, since Cassandra's primary key lookups are very efficient. 

```cql
CREATE TABLE users_by_username (
    username text PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id uuid,
    email text,
    password_hash text,
    join_date timestamp,
    last_login timestamp
);

CREATE TABLE users_by_email (
    email text PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id uuid,
    username text,
    password_hash text,
    join_date timestamp,
    last_login timestamp
);
```

### 2. Listing Videos Uploaded by a Specific User

**Influence on Design:** The requirement to list videos by a specific user leads to the creation of a `videos_by_user` table where `user_id` is the partition key. This design choice ensures that all videos uploaded by a user are stored together, facilitating efficient retrieval.

### 3. Incrementing Video Views

**Influence on Design:** To support efficiently updating video views, you must have `video_id` easily accessible and possibly partitioned in such a way that incrementing the view count is a simple and fast operation. This suggests that video metadata, including views, should be stored in a manner where `video_id` is a key part of the primary key, as shown in the `videos_by_user` table design.

### 4. Fetching Comments for a Specific Video

**Influence on Design:** This necessitates a `comments_by_video` table where `video_id` is the partition key, allowing for all comments on a video to be stored and retrieved together efficiently.

### 5. Retrieving Comments Made by a Specific User

**Influence on Design:** Similar to fetching comments for a specific video, retrieving comments by a user requires a `comments_by_user` table with `user_id` as the partition key. This ensures comments made by a user are grouped together.

### 6. Listing Users Who Liked a Specific Video

**Influence on Design:** This query leads to the creation of a `likes_by_video` table with `video_id` as the partition key. Each row in this table would represent a like, keyed by video, allowing you to retrieve all users who liked a specific video quickly.

### 7. Tracking Videos Liked by a User

**Influence on Design:** To efficiently track videos liked by a user, a `likes_by_user` table is required, with `user_id` as the partition key. This design choice directly supports the query pattern by grouping all likes by a particular user together.

### 8. Viewing Channel Subscriptions

**Influence on Design:** Viewing which channels a user is subscribed to leads to a `subscriptions_by_user` table, where `subscriber_id` is the partition key. This design efficiently supports queries to find all channels that a specific user is subscribed to.

### Summary

Each of these queries directly influences the design of your Cassandra database by dictating:
- How tables are structured and what the partition keys should be.
- The necessity of creating additional tables to support efficient retrieval based on different attributes (e.g., `username`, `email`, `user_id`, `video_id`).
- The importance of designing your database schema based on your application's query patterns rather than attempting to normalize data as you would in a relational database system.
